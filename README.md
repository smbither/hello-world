Intro to GitHub repository

This is an experiment in setting up and using GitHub. This seems really cool and way more efficient than saving a bunch of different word documents and trying to merge them. Even more useful than Google docs since you can view, comment, and reject/accept changes before making them permanent in the master copy.
